# Contributing to this Project

Although this project is small on a lines-of-code basis, it incorporates a variety of technologies that are not commonly used together.
This is likely to lead to problems as individual libraries are updated.

As a reminder, this is only a spare-time project for a single person, so there's no assurance that issues will be responded to in a timely manner (or, in the event of tragedy, at all).
As an alternative to this project, applying modest pressure to Microsoft to resume active development of the .NET Core 2.0 template has a remote chance of getting some results.

In the worst case scenario, you may need to gain deeper familiarity with the technologies used so you can repair problems yourself.

## 3rd Party Library Issues

You're welcome to file issues along these lines (can't upgrade library _x_ because _y_), and if you're able to fork this project and fix them yourself, pull requests will be greatly appreciated.

## Enhancements

Adding additional 3rd party libraries is undesirable given how complex this project already is, but enhanced usage of technologies that are already in place will be welcomed.
You're more than welcome to fork or copy this library to suit your needs, of course.
